# Math-Lego 迈思乐高

### Build up your patterns using Lego pieces bsaed on Python！

When I was in my teens, I used to have a big box of Lego. 
Based on thousands of simple Lego pieces,  I build my world of 
knights, wizards, princesses，pirates and monsters.

Decades later, as a computer science student, I am obsessed with the question: 
Would it be possible to use Python to create a set of Lego pieces, 
based on which people could easily build more complex and more beautiful patterns.

Here, I'd like to present my answer so far.

### Introduction
No matter how splendid the Lego world is, 
it is build from very simple Lego pieces.

Likewise, our Math-Lego is based on three simple Math-Lego pieces: 
**Constant Bender**, **Linear Bender** and **Sin Bender**.
The shape of each piece is restricted by a different type of derivative. 
By combining these simple Math-Lego pieces together, 
you may create complex and beautiful patterns on a **Matplotlib** "paper".

### Basic Math-Lego Pieces

#### Constant Bender

**Constant Bender** let you create a curved line with a constant curvature. 
You may adjust the curvature to create a more curved line.

#### Sin Bender

The curvature of a **Sin Bender** is a sinusoid. 
I.e. the curvature gradually increases to reach a peak, 
and then gradually falls back.
It is usually applied to create a sharp curve.

#### Linear Bender

A continuous line would usually look more beautiful it is smooth 
(i.e. No abrupt change in curvature)
This requires the function of the line to be differentiable, which means the derivative of the function is continuous. 

The curvature of a **Linear Bender** is a linear function, 
(i.e. the curvature gradually changes from a constant value to another constant value)
Linear Bender could be applied to connect two Math-Lego pieces of different curvature, making the transformation look more smooth. 
It could also be applied to create a line with different curvature at different points.

### Advanced Math-Lego Pieces

In addition to simple Math-Lego pieces, 
we also offer some advanced Math-Lego pieces.
The advanced Math-Lego pieces are made from simple Math-Lego pieces, 
but encapsulated in a way that is easy to be called by users.



You may also write advanced Math-Lego pieces by yourself!
